# COMP3400-Team-3-Hospital-Management-System
Welcome to the COMP3400 Team 3 Hospital Management System developed by Mustafa, Murtaza and Spondon.

Here in this project, our group will be utilizing Object-Oriented Programming language C++ that uses core content from our lectures. You will notice content used such as constructors, overloading, OOP concepts like inheritance and many more to come.

## Before getting started on this Directory
This project is focused on using a text-based that will use the console terminal. Most of the work showcased will be on the console to provide a better structured Hospital Management System. Ensure that you have C++ version up to date and installed to be able to run this project. The command to run this program is essentially the command used in our content and lectures.

## Core classes for this Hospital Management System
The management system will operate core classes such as Hospitals, Patients, Doctors, Pharmacies & Nurses. Each of these core classes have their own purpose that will be implemented onto the main code.
The implementation will focus on the system managing the core classes
More information to come later...
