# COMP3400-Team-3-Hospital-Management-System
Welcome to the COMP3400 Team 3 Hospital Management System developed by Mustafa, Murtaza and Spondon.

Here in this project, our group will be utilizing Object-Oriented Programming language C++ that uses core content from our lectures. You will notice content used such as constructors, overloading, OOP concepts like inheritance and many more to come.

## Before getting started on this Directory
This project uses a GUI when compiling this repository. Please have fltk downloaded and installed onto your operating system to ensure the best experience when reviewing the project. Without the fltk installed, you will not be able to view the compilation. In order to proceed with this please go to the fltk website and see which download method you will need to follow based on your operating system (ex. Windows, MacOS, Linux or Ubuntu).

## Install the FLTK GUI onto your Operating System
As mentioned this project uses the FLTK commands as our GUI base. To install the FLTK onto your operating system here are the steps required:
For Windows:
Use this link: https://www.fltk.org/
This will allow you to grab their tar files or simply use their git link if possible. One of the 2 options will be enough

For Linux/MacOS:
sudo apt install libfltk1.3-dev  # Ubuntu/Debian
brew install fltk                # macOS
One of these commands depending on your operating system will allow you to download the FLTK GUI.

## Core classes for this Hospital Management System
The management system will operate core classes such as Hospitals, Patients, Doctors, Pharmacies & Nurses. Each of these core classes have their own purpose that will be implemented onto the main code.
The implementation will focus on the system managing the core classes
