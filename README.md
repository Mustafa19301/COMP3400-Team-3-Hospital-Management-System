# COMP3400-Team-3-Hospital-Management-System
Welcome to the COMP3400 Team 3 Hospital Management System developed by Mustafa, Murtaza and Spondon.

Here in this project, our group will be utilizing Object-Oriented Programming language C++ that uses core content from our lectures. You will notice content used such as constructors, overloading, OOP concepts like inheritance and many more to come.

## Core classes for this Hospital Management System
The management system will operate core classes such as Hospitals, Patients, Doctors, Pharmacies & Nurses. Each of these core classes have their own purpose that will be implemented onto the main code.
The implementation will focus on the system managing the core classes
More information to come later...
